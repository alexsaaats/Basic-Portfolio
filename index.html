<h1>My Background</h1>
	<img src="#" FLOAT>
	<p>
	I lead technology for NOWaccount Network Corporation, a B2B finance service. I also lead Decycive, a technology development and support firm. We work with startups and enterprises to build and maintain technology platforms. <br/>

	I've started and successfully exited a few small ventures and worked in a variety of leadership roles within the marketing and technology arena. For the past 5 years, I have been focused on product management and architecture for enterprise CRM, CMS, and cloud applications. Today I focus most of my time on leading technology development teams and related projects.<br/>
